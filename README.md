# CTD_PreWork
This repo is for my CTD Prework assignment. Here I will be building a website using cat API


In this project, I used 2 API to make my website. The first API is the imaging API where I used to create "Ramdom picture of the day and the cat gallery". The second used on API was the breed API, used to find The Purrfect Breed by matching user's reseponse to answers from Breed API

The general idea: 
1. website -> name IDK
2. Home page, Cat galary. called CAT DUMP! crazy cat pictures
3. then there is a side tab that will take you to second tab where you answer questions that will identity which cat bread is best for you!
