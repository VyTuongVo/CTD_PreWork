# CTD_PreWork
This repo is for my CTD Prework assignment. Here I will be building a website using cat API


The general idea: 
1. website -> name IDK
2. Home page, Cat galary. called CAT DUMP! crazy cat pictures
3. then there is a side tab that will take you to second tab where you answer questions that will identity which cat bread is best for you!
